in this project I perform many data cleaning tasks. In order to create one visualization (and not even the final one), I completed the following tasks:

- Explored the data and figured out how to prepare it for analysis
- Corrected some of the missing values
- Dropped any data not needed for our analysis
- Renamed our columns
- Verified the quality of our data
- Created a new institute_service column
- Cleaned the Contributing Factors columns
- Created a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
- Combined the data
- Cleaned the institute_service column
- Handled the missing values in the dissatisfied column
- Aggregated the data
